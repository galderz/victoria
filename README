Victoria -  JBoss Cache Across Data Centres 
========================================================

- Do I need to install Gradle in advance to build Victoria?
-----------------------------------------------------------
No! The first time you execute gradlew/gradlew.bat, it will download gradle, 
unzip it and use that gradle version. So, to start do the following:

Linux/Unix: sh gradlew testCompile
Windows: gradlew.bat testCompile

- How to import Victoria into Eclipse?
--------------------------------------
After doing testCompile, call so that Eclipse project and classpath files are generated:

Linux/Unix: sh gradlew eclipse
Windows: gradlew.bat eclipse

- How to import Victoria into IntelliJ?
---------------------------------------
Unfortunately, Gradle does not yet support IntelliJ project file generation 
(see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRADLE-190), so to help IntelliJ users, I've
added IntelliJ project files at the root of Victoria.

However, these project files cannot be used just like that. Gradle downloads Victoria's
dependency jars to a folder called ~/.gradle, so victoria.iml needs to be modified so 
that the distance between the folder to which Victoria was cloned and ~/.gradle it's the 
correct one.

- How to clean Victoria?
------------------------
Linux/Unix: sh gradlew clean
Windows: gradlew.bat clean

- Why did I pull org.jboss.test package from jboss-test?
--------------------------------------------------------
To bring only the classes needed and avoid in AS test classes being brought 
and the entire AS 5 as dependencies.  

WARNING: If you put jboss-test as test compile dependency, eclipse file 
generation will fail with the following (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRADLE-415):

		[NOT FOUND  ] org.jboss.jbossas#jboss-as-j2se;5.0.0.CR2!jboss-as-j2se.test-jar (492ms)

	==== jboss: tried

	  http://repository.jboss.org/maven2/org/jboss/jbossas/jboss-as-j2se/5.0.0.CR2/jboss-as-j2se-5.0.0.CR2.test-jar

To get around it:

Open ~/.gradle/cache/org.jboss.jbossas/jboss-as-jmx/ivy-5.0.0.CR2.xml file and 
change the following line:

<dependency org="org.jboss.jbossas" name="jboss-as-j2se" rev="5.0.0.CR2" force="true" conf="compile->compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)">
   <artifact name="jboss-as-j2se" type="test-jar" ext="test-jar" conf=""/>
</dependency>
 		
so that it looks like this:

<dependency org="org.jboss.jbossas" name="jboss-as-j2se" rev="5.0.0.CR2" force="true" conf="compile->compile(*),master(*);runtime->runtime(*)">
  <artifact name="jboss-as-j2se" type="test-jar" ext="jar" conf="tests" m:classifier="tests"/>
</dependency>
